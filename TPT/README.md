## Instructions for a better code management:
### 1.Fork this repository to your own github and work on it:
This enables the contributers to review the code before merging it

### 2.Use data binding in android instead of findViewById().
### 3.The fragments for each section(taxi,marchandise,medical,covoiturage) is already created to define a starting point.
### 4.Use color attributes and do not use direct color codes in the project.
### 5.when you finish a section commit it and send a pull request for review.
